<p>More and more applications are being distributed on the Cloud and external platform providers. As such, scalability and performance becomes increasingly important for distributed systems. The cost of poorly scalable systems and high latency can be high, consider the following real-life examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon found for every 100ms of latency cost them 1% in Sales</li>
</ul>
