Following a dispute over TCK licensing for the Apache Harmony project, ASF has quit the JCP.
ASF explains their move [here][1].

> In the phrase "fail to uphold their responsibilities under the JSPA", we are referring
> to Oracle's refusal to provide the ASF's Harmony project with a TCK
> license for Java SE that complies with Oracle's obligations under the
> JSPA as well as public promises made to the Java community by officers
> of Sun Microsystems (recently acquired by Oracle.)  This breach of the
> JSPA was begun by Sun Microsystems in August of 2006 and is a policy
> that Oracle explicitly continues today.  For more information on this
> dispute, see our [open letter to Sun Microsystems][2].

Further, they provide some strong conclusive remarks:

> The Apache Software Foundation concludes that that JCP is not an open specification process - 
> that Java  specifications are proprietary technology that must be licensed directly  from the spec lead under whatever terms the spec lead chooses; that the  commercial concerns of a single entity, Oracle, will continue to  seriously interfere with and bias the transparent governance of the  ecosystem;  that it is impossible to distribute independent  implementations of JSRs under open source licenses such that users are  protected from IP litigation by expert group members or the spec lead;  and finally, the EC is unwilling or unable to assert the basic power of  their role in the JCP governance process.

It is a real shame they are leaving, as they have contributed significantly to the Java Ecosystem. This departure follow recent ones from Doug Lea and Tim Peierls who voted against Java SE JSRs.
Looks like Java is going to have an interesting future ahead.
