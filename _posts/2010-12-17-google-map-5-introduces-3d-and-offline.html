<p><strong>Google Maps 5 </strong>for [[android]] introduces some awesome features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tilting:</strong> Drag down with two fingers to tilt the map. Tilt while zoomed in on one of the [http://www.google.com/mobile/maps/3d  100+ cities] around the world with 3D buildings to see a skyline spring to life.</li>
<li><strong>Rotating:</strong> Twist with two fingers to rotate the map. After tilting to see 3D buildings, rotate around them to gain a new perspective from any direction.</li>
<li><strong>Smooth zooming:</strong> Slide two fingers together or apart, and see the map and labels continuously scale to any zoom level, stopping when your fingers stop.</li>
<li><strong>Compass mode:</strong> Center the map on your location, and then tap the compass button in the top right corner. The map will flip into 3D mode and start rotating to match your perspective, while still keeping all the labels upright and readable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Offline Caching and Rerouting</strong><br />
Rather than having a static set of maps when installed, Maps will automatically start caching the areas you visit the most when your device is plugged in and connected to WiFi. You’ll still need a connection to start a route, but if you miss a turn along the way, Google Maps Navigation will quickly get you back on track, even if you don’t have an Internet connection.</p>
