This is amazing - NASA finds two bubble like structures over and under the center of our galaxy. This could be related to the super massive galaxy at the center of our galaxy.
It could be remnant of an explosion or eruption from the black hole.

This detection was made possible by the Fermi Satellite (2008) - Fermi scans the whole sky every 3 hours - scanning the sky in ever increasing detail
