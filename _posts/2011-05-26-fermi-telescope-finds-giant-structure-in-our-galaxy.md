<p>This is amazing - NASA finds two bubble like structures over and under the center of our galaxy. This could be related to the super massive galaxy at the center of our galaxy.</p>
<p>It could be remnant of an explosion or eruption from the black hole.</p>
<p>This detection was made possible by the Fermi Satellite (2008) - Fermi scans the whole sky every 3 hours - scanning the sky in ever increasing detail</p>
